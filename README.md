## Troubleshooting
### Tor Connection Issues
If you encounter Tor connection errors:

1. Verify Tor is running:
````
# Windows
tasklist | findstr tor

# macOS/Linux
ps aux | grep tor
````

2. Make sure the SOCKS port (default: 9050) is not blocked by a firewall.
3. If you're still having issues, try editing the configuration in tor_service.py to use an existing Tor instance:
```
# Modify the tor_config to use an existing Tor instance
tor_config = {
    'SocksPort': str(self.socks_port),
    'ControlPort': '9051',
    # Use an existing data directory
    'DataDirectory': '/path/to/existing/tor/data',
    'HiddenServiceDir': self.hidden_service_dir,
    'HiddenServicePort': f'{self.hidden_service_port} 127.0.0.1:{self.hidden_service_port}'
}
````

### Permission Issues
On macOS and Linux, ensure the hidden service directory has the correct permissions:
````
bashchmod 700 ~/.tor
chmod 700 ~/.tor/hidden_service
````
### Group Chat Issues
If group chat synchronization is not working:
1. Make sure all members are using the same version of the application.
2. Verify that all members have proper network connectivity.
3. Check the logs for any specific error messages.
